// Write your code here

// Challenge 1: Create a variable called multiply that multiplies num1 and num2 to equal 62
let num1 = 31;
let num2 = 2;
let multiply = num1 * num2;

// Challenge 2: Create a variable called random that generates a random integer greater than 0
let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

// Challenge 3: Create a variable called mod that calculates the remainder of num3 divided by num4, resulting in 4
let num3 = 28;
let num4 = 12;
let mod = num3 % num4;

// Challenge 4: Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set, returning 20
let max = Math.max(5, 10, 15, 20);
